# it115-bio
A place to keep thoughts about what to put in my professional biography. 
Hello Everyone! My name is Cesar Cantarero and I am currently a year up student studying Software development.
I am also working a part time job at a non-profit soccer complex named Starfire Sports, where our main goal is to introduce the sport of soccer to younger kids.
I am someone who is very hard working and caring. 
on my free time I am someone who love watching movies and going to the gym.
