Go back to Heather's video and write a few notes about what to put in my bio here:

1.) Identify your audience
2.) powerful first sentence 
3.) tell a compelling story
4.) create a call to action
5.) Wrap it up with Personality 
A place to keep thoughts about what to put in my professional biography. Hello Everyone! My name is Cesar Cantarero and I am currently a year up student studying Software development. 
I am also working a part time job at a non-profit soccer complex named Starfire Sports, where our main goal is to introduce the sport of soccer to younger kids. I am someone who is very hard working and caring. 
on my free time I am someone who love watching movies and going to the gym.
